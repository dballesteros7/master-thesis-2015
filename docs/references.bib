abstract = {This work aims to build a system to suggest tourist destinations based on visual matching and minimal user input. A user can provide either a photo of the desired scenary or a keyword describing the place of interest, and the system will look into its database for places that share the visual characteristics. To that end, we first cluster a large-scale geotagged web photo collection into groups by location and then find the representative images for each group. Tourist destination recommendations are produced by comparing the query against the representative tags or representative images under the premise of "if you like that place, you may also like these places".},

abstract = {Leveraging community-contributed data (e.g., blogs, GPS logs, and geo-tagged photos) for travel recommendation is one of the active researches since there are rich contexts and trip activities in such explosively growing data. In this work, we focus on personalized travel recommendation by leveraging the freely available community-contributed photos. We propose to conduct personalized travel recommendation by further considering specific user profiles or attributes (e.g., gender, age, race). In stead of mining photo logs only, we argue to leverage the automatically detected people attributes in the photo contents. By information-theoretic measures, we will demonstrate that such people attributes are informative and effective for travel recommendation -- especially providing a promising aspect for personalization. We effectively mine the demographics for different locations (or landmarks) and travel paths. A probabilistic Bayesian learning framework which further entails mobile recommendation on the spot is introduced. We experiment on four million photos collected for eight major worldwide cities. The experiments confirm that people attributes are promising and orthogonal to prior works using travel logs only and can further improve prior travel recommendation methods especially in difficult predictions by further leveraging user contexts in mobile devices.},

abstract = {Recently, the Internet has made a lot of services and products appear online provided by many tourism sectors. By this way, many information such as timetables, routes, accommodations, and restaurants are easily available to help travelers plan their travels. However, how to plan the most appropriate travel schedule under simultaneously considering several factors such as tourist attractions visiting, local hotels selecting, and travel budget calculation is a challenge. This gives rise to our interest in exploring the recommendation systems with relation to schedule recommendation. Additionally, the personalized concept is not implemented completely in most of travel recommendation systems. One notable problem is that they simply recommended the most popular travel routes or projects, and cannot plan the travel schedule. Moreover, the existing travel planning systems have limits in their capabilities to adapt to the changes based on users' requirements and planning results. To tackle these problems, we develop a personalized travel planning system that simultaneously considers all categories of user requirements and provides users with a travel schedule planning service that approximates automation. A novel travel schedule planning algorithm is embedded to plan travel schedules based on users' need. Through the user-adapted interface and adjustable results design, users can replace any unsatisfied travel unit to specific one. The feedback mechanism provides a better accuracy rate for next travel schedule to new users. An experiment was conducted to examine the satisfaction and use intention of the system. The results showed that participants who used the system with schedule planning have statistical significant on user satisfaction and use intention. We also analyzed the validity of applying the proposed algorithm to a user preference travel schedule through a number of practical system tests. In addition, comparing with other travel recommendation systems, our system had better performance on the schedule adjustment, personalization, and feedback giving. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We describe a framework for automatically selecting a summary set of photos from a large collection of geo-referenced photographs. Such large collections are inherently difficult to browse, and become excessively so as they grow in size, making summaries an important tool in rendering these collections accessible. Our summary algorithm is based on spa-tial patterns in photo sets, as well as textual-topical patterns and user (photographer) identity cues. The algorithm can be expanded to support social, temporal, and other factors. The summary can thus be biased by the content of the query, the user making the query, and the context in which the query is made.A modified version of our summarization algorithm serves as a basis for a new map-based visualization of large collections of geo-referenced photos, called Tag Maps. Tag Maps visualize the data by placing highly representative textual tags on relevant map locations in the viewed region, effectively providing a sense of the important concepts embodied in the collection.An initial evaluation of our implementation on a set of geo-referenced photos shows that our algorithm and visualization perform well, producing summaries and views that are highly rated by users.},

abstract = {The advent of media-sharing sites like Flickr and YouTube has drastically increased the volume of community-contributed multimedia resources available on the web. These collections have a previously unimagined depth and breadth, and have generated new opportunities – and new challenges – to multimedia research. How do we analyze, understand and extract patterns from these new collections? How can we use these unstructured, unrestricted community contributions of media (and annotation) to generate “knowledge”? As a test case, we study Flickr – a popular photo sharing website. Flickr supports photo, time and location metadata, as well as a light-weight annotation model. We extract information from this dataset using two different approaches. First, we employ a location-driven approach to generate aggregate knowledge in the form of “representative tags” for arbitrary areas in the world. Second, we use a tag-driven approach to automatically extract place and event semantics for Flickr tags, based on each tag’s metadata patterns. With the patterns we extract from tags and metadata, vision algorithms can be employed with greater precision. In particular, we demonstrate a location-tag-vision-based approach to retrieving images of geography-related landmarks and features from the Flickr dataset. The results suggest that community-contributed media and annotation can enhance and improve our access to multimedia resources – and our understanding of the world.},

In contrast to traditional structured models like Markov random fields, which become intractable and hard to approximate in the presence of negative correlations, DPPs offer efficient and exact algorithms for sampling, marginalization, conditioning, and other inference tasks. We provide a gentle introduction to DPPs, focusing on the intuitions, algorithms, and extensions that are most relevant to the machine learning community, and show how DPPs can be applied to real-world applications like finding diverse sets of high-quality search results, building informative summaries by selecting diverse sentences from documents, modeling non-overlapping human poses in images or video, and automatically building timelines of important news stories.},

Assuming that the collection of each photographer's geotagged photos is a sequence of visited locations, photo-sharing sites are important sources for gathering the location histories of tourists. By following their location sequences, we can find representative and diverse travel routes that link key landmarks. In this paper, we propose a travel route recommendation method that makes use of the photographers' histories as held by Flickr. Recommendations are performed by our photographer behavior model, which estimates the probability of a photographer visiting a landmark. We incorporate user preference and present location information into the probabilistic behavior model by combining topic models and Markov models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a real-life dataset holding information from 71,718 photographers taken in the United States in terms of the prediction accuracy of travel behavior.},

Recent research in object recognition has used such sites as a source of image data, but the test images have been selected and labeled by hand, yielding relatively small validation sets. In this paper we study image classification on a much larger dataset of 30 million images, including nearly 2 million of which have been labeled into one of 500 categories. The dataset and categories are formed automatically from geotagged photos from Flickr, by looking for peaks in the spatial geotag distribution corresponding to frequently-photographed landmarks. We learn models for these landmarks with a multiclass support vector machine, using vector-quantized interest point descriptors as features. We also explore the non-visual information available on modern photo-sharing sites, showing that using textual tags and temporal constraints leads to significant improvements in classification rate. We find that in some cases image features alone yield comparable classification accuracy to using text tags as well as to the performance of human observers.},
