Firstly, I would like to sincerely express my gratitude to Prof. Andreas Krause who has been an outstanding advisor not only during the course of this thesis but all of my master studies. His insightful comments and suggestions were always opportune and of great help to move forward.

To my supervisors, Dr. Sebastian Tschiatschek and Alkis Gotovos, I am immensely indebted for their dedication and constant support throughout the last six months. I am thankful for the valuable discussions that we had.

I would also like to thank my colleagues at the ETH for their encouragement and motivation, it has been a great opportunity to share this experience with them.

Lastly but not least, to my loved ones, whether they are close or far away, I am deeply thankful for their unwavering support.
