The increasing popularity of photo sharing sites such and Flickr or Instagram has created a unique opportunity for researchers to harness large collections of images and extract useful knowledge from them. One interesting application is the use of geotagged photos to model the behavior of tourists in a city. Temporal and geographical information attached to the photos was used to identify paths taken by tourists and locals through the city, these paths were then modeled using a probabilistic submodular model. Namely, FLID was applied to model diversity in these sets and learn the distribution of visits to subsets of all the locations. In this work, we extend the FLID model to incoporate attractiveness, in order to model the concept of coherence, and propose the integration of features to allow the generalization of the model to unseen elements. We show how these models can represent complex distributions and how they can be applied to the task of recommending touristic attractions to visit, using geotagged photos taken between 2005 and 2015 in ZÃ¼rich.
