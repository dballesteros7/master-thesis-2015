The increasing popularity of photo sharing sites such as Flickr and Instagram has created a unique opportunity for researchers to harness large collections of images and extract useful knowledge from them. One interesting application is the use of geotagged photos to analyze the behavior of tourists in a city, e.g. to identify commonly visited locations. In this work, we use probabilistic submodular models (PSMs), a class of distributions over sets, to model sets of visited locations. In particular, we start with the facility location diversity model, a PSM proposed by \citet{tschiatschek16learning} for modeling diversity, and extend it to also model attractive behavior. Furthermore, we propose the integration of features to enable the model to generalize to previously unseen locations. In experiments, we demonstate that these models can represent complex distributions over sets of locations. Moreover, using geotagged photos taken between 2005 and 2015 in Zurich, we show how these models can be applied to the task of recommending touristic attractions to visit.
