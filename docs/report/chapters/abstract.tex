The increasing popularity of photo sharing sites such and Flickr or Instagram has created a unique opportunity for researchers to harness large collections of images and extract useful knowledge from them. One interesting application is the use of geotagged photos to model the behavior of tourists in a city. Modeling the underlying factors that drive visitors around a city allow us to automatically identify attractions and recommend touristic routes. This is similar to the summarization task, where the most representative elements from a large set are identified and presented in a concise manner. Probabilistic submodular models have been recently used for summarization, in particular the FLID model was proposed as a class of distributions that can naturally model diversity and be efficiently estimated from data. In this work, we extend the FLID model to incoporate supermodularity, in order to model the concept of coherence, and propose the integration of features to allow the generalization of the model to unseen elements. We show how these models can represent complex distributions and how they can be applied to the task of recommending touristic attractions to visit, using geotagged photos taken between 2005 and 2015 in ZÃ¼rich.
